Running the preferences editors

In the new subdirectory "prefsEditors" you will find this README.md file, 
a few other files and a few directories. 

Copy the folders "demos", "src" and "tests" to a web server of your choice.

Identify the URL that would point to the file prefsEditors/demos/prefsEditor/index.html
on the web server and enter that URL in your browser to run the preferences editors.
